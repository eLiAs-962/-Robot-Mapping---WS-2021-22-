# -Robot-Mapping---WS-2021-22-
These are the solutions to all the sheets of the robot mapping course 
http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws21/mapping/

The solution contains pdf files for briefly discussing the idea of each sheet and the code associated with it.
The code is, in some cases, concise due to the application of some linear algebra tricks! be carefu!  

This repo. will be updated sooner with other tasks and projects including the Lie-Group and exponanital maaping implementation for solving the full SLAM problem.
